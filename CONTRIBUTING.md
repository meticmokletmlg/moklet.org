## Code of Conduct

Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- **Search Existing Issues**: Before reporting, check if the issue already exists.
- **Create a New Issue**: If not found, open a new issue with detailed information, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and screenshots if necessary.

### Rules for Verified Issues

- **Labeling**: Verified issues will have the label `todo`.
- **Open for Contribution**: Anyone can work on `todo` issues **if they are not assigned to someone**.
- **Self-Assignment**: You can assign yourself to an issue to indicate that you are working on it.
- **Claiming an Issue**: Leave a comment to express your intent to work on a `todo` issue before assigning it to yourself.

### Submitting Pull Requests

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- **Branch Selection**: 
  - For simple changes, you can commit directly to the `development` branch of your fork.  
  - For more complex changes, create a new branch in your fork with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-user-auth` or `bugfix/fix-navbar-issue`).
- **Implement Changes**: Make your changes and ensure they align with the project's code formatting and guidelines.
- **Write a Clear Description**: When opening a pull request (PR), provide a clear and concise description of your changes, including:  
  - The purpose of the PR.  
  - Any relevant details about the implementation.  
  - How the changes improve the project.
- **Link to Issues**:  
  If your PR is related to an issue, link it to the issue by following [GitHub's guide for linking pull requests to issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). This helps maintain traceability and context for the changes.
  - Example: Include text like `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456` in your PR description to automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged.
- **Submit the PR**: Open a pull request to the `development` branch of the main repository. Collaborators will review your changes and provide feedback if necessary.

### Discussions

- Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/mokletdev/moklet.org/discussions) for brainstorming ideas, seeking feedback, or discussing potential features. This helps maintain clear communication among contributors.

## Style Guidelines

- **Code Formatting**: Follow the project's `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` configurations.
- **Commit Messages**: Use clear and descriptive messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for structured commit messages.
